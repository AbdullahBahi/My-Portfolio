# Deep Neural Networks Implementation
  
An implementation of a Deep Neural Network using both:  
1. standard scientific computation libraries (**i.e. Building from scratch**) 
2. **TensorFlow Framework**  
  
## Overview
  
Starting from the very simple concept of **linear and logistic regression**, this set of jupyter Notebooks walks through the process of building **Deep Neural Networks** from scratch without using any **Machine Learning Frameworks** at first. Then we use the neural network we built in a simple application where we classify images as a **"cat"** or **"not cat"** and measure  the accuracy of our model. Then we expand our experience by building a deep neural network using **TensorFlow Framework** and use this neural network as an image classifier for hand signs.  
  
**NOTE:** These Notebooks are some of the programming assignments I successfully passed while attending both [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) 
and [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning) 
Courses which are the **first** and **second** courses of [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) 
offerd by [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on **Coursera**.
