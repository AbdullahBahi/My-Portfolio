# Self-Driving Cars - Visual Perception

In this project, I used:
- Object detection
- Object tracking 
- Semantic segmentation
- Image processing techniques (Feature Extraction, Feature description, edge detection, ...etc) 

to extract useful scene information which allows self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment. 
This project is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Outline:

1.  Use the output of **semantic segmentation** neural networks to implement **Drivable Space Estimation (DSE)** in 3D.

2.  Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement **Lane Estimation**.

3.  Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D **Object Detection Models**.

4.  Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car **(Depth Mapping)**.

5. Use **Feature Matching** and **Feature Descripting** techniques to perform **Visual Odometry** which helps with ego localization.
