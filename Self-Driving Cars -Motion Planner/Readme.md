![0](.)

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is building a functional motion planning stack that can avoid both static and dynamic obstacles while tracking the center line of a lane, while also handling stop signs. To accomplish this, I implemented The following blocks and the integrated them:

-   Behavioral planning logic
-   Static collision checking
-   Path generation
-   Path selection
-   Velocity profile generation
